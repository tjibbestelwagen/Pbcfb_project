# Pbcfb_project

Contains all files for the bio-informatics and computing course project:



Kenaispecies contains all data on observations in the Kenai geographic region: species, coordinates and years observed.

Specieslist Kenai contains a list of all species and the total number of observations

alldata.txt is the file pulled form the original database by making a query in MS ACCESS

nppsd.zip contains the files as retrieved from http://alaska.usgs.gov/products/data.php?dataid=1

Kenaimap.pdf is an empty map of the kenai peninsula made with R marmasp. 

mapmarmap is a failed mapas a result of a not yet correctly working shell function

Common_Murre.txt is output generated by the Python script 'makefile' - used it to do tests with

makefile.py generates a file with coordinates for user input selection of year and species - it is the predecessor of the next;

enter_species_and_year.py - hast two outputsetting - matching the input below (intended for use in shell function)
the script is partially based on examples from ' practical computing for biologists' 

mapping_kenai_species.R it has two settings for input file: one generic for the shell function, and one 'manual'.
This scripts is an adapted version of the one provided by Michael Fontaine for the course 'bioinformatics and computing for biologists'  at RuG.

There are 3 maps included as an example of marmap output displaying data
